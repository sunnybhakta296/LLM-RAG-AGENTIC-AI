## LLM vs RAG vs Agentic AI

| Concept      | Description |
|:------------ |:-----------|
| **LLM**      | Large Language Model. Neural network trained on vast text data to generate, summarize, and answer questions in natural language. Examples: GPT-4, Llama. |
| **RAG**      | Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Combines LLMs with external search or retrieval systems. Fetches relevant documents or facts from a database or the web, then generates answers using both retrieved data and its own knowledge. |
| **Agentic AI** | AI systems that act autonomously to achieve goals, often using LLMs and RAG techniques. Can plan, reason, interact with tools/APIs, and adapt actions based on feedback, simulating “agent-like” behavior. |
