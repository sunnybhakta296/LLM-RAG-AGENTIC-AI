# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external data sources. RAG systems retrieve relevant information from databases, documents, or APIs and use it to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Key Concepts in RAG

- **Retriever**: Searches and fetches relevant documents or data from external sources.
- **Generator**: LLM that synthesizes answers using both retrieved data and its own knowledge.
- **Indexing**: Organizing data for efficient retrieval (vector databases, embeddings, etc.).
- **Chunking**: Splitting documents into manageable pieces for better retrieval.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combining keyword and semantic search for improved results.
- **Context Window**: The amount of retrieved data passed to the LLM for generation.
- **Feedback Loop**: Using user feedback or model output to refine retrieval and generation.

## Example RAG Workflow

1. **User asks a question.**
2. **Retriever searches external sources for relevant data.**
3. **Retrieved data is passed to the LLM (generator).**
4. **LLM generates a response using both its own knowledge and the retrieved context.**

## RAG Code Example (Python with LangChain)

Below is a simplified example using LangChain to build a RAG pipeline. This code demonstrates retrieving relevant documents and generating an answer using an LLM.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "RAG combines retrieval with generation for better answers.",
    "LangChain is a popular framework for building RAG pipelines.",
    "Vector databases like FAISS enable efficient document retrieval."
]

# Create embeddings and vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(documents, embeddings)

# Set up retriever and LLM
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Build RAG pipeline
qa_chain = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)

# Ask a question
question = "What is LangChain used for?"
answer = qa_chain.run(question)
print(answer)
```

### Explanation

- **Documents**: Sample knowledge base.
- **Embeddings & Vector Store**: Documents are embedded and stored for semantic search.
- **Retriever**: Finds relevant documents for a given query.
- **LLM**: Generates answers using retrieved context.
- **Pipeline**: Combines retrieval and generation to answer questions.

### Example Output

```
LangChain is a popular framework for building RAG pipelines.
```
