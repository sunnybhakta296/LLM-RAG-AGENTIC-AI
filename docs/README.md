## LLM vs RAG vs Agentic AI

| Concept      | Description |
|:------------ |:-----------|
| **LLM**      | Large Language Model. Neural network trained on vast text data to generate, summarize, and answer questions in natural language. Examples: GPT-4, Llama. |
| **RAG**      | Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Combines LLMs with external search or retrieval systems. Fetches relevant documents or facts from a database or the web, then generates answers using both retrieved data and its own knowledge. |
| **Agentic AI** | AI systems that act autonomously to achieve goals, often using LLMs and RAG techniques. Can plan, reason, interact with tools/APIs, and adapt actions based on feedback, simulating “agent-like” behavior. |

### 1. LLM (Large Language Model)

**Definition:**  
A Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM, Claude) is a deep learning model trained on extensive text data to generate human-like text.

**Key Points:**
- Generates text based on learned patterns.
- Limited to knowledge up to its training data cutoff unless connected to external sources.
- Operates primarily via prompts to produce responses.

**Use Cases:**  
Essay writing, text summarization, code generation, language translation, Q&A based on learned knowledge.

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Definition:**  
RAG enhances LLM output by retrieving relevant external documents or data during generation.

**How It Works:**
- Retrieves information from a database or knowledge base in response to a query.
- Augments the LLM prompt with retrieved data.
- LLM generates responses using both its knowledge and the new information.

**Key Benefit:**  
Provides up-to-date, accurate answers using current or proprietary data not in the original training set.

**Use Cases:**  
Legal assistant referencing case law, company chatbot consulting product manuals from a private knowledge base.

### 3. Agentic AI (LLM Agents)

**Definition:**  
Agentic AI systems autonomously decide actions, often interacting with external tools, APIs, or systems—beyond simple text generation.

**How It Works:**
- Plans steps based on user input.
- Invokes APIs, runs searches, manipulates files, calls other models, etc.
- Utilizes reasoning, planning, and execution loops.

**Example Frameworks:**  
LangChain agents, AutoGPT, BabyAGI.

**Key Benefit:**  
Interactive and autonomous; capable of multi-step problem solving, task execution, and tool use.

**Use Cases:**  
Virtual assistant booking flights, sending emails, checking weather, summarizing emails, and scheduling meetings in one flow.

| Concept        | Main Role           | Key Feature                     | Example Use Case               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **LLM**        | Text generation     | Generates text from prompt      | Write essay, chat, translate   |
| **RAG**        | LLM + retrieval     | Uses external data for accuracy | Answer questions from docs     |
| **Agentic AI** | Autonomous AI agent | Acts, plans, calls tools/APIs   | Personal assistant doing tasks |
